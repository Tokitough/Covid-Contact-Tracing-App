3. "Add an entry" button opens a new window where you can add your information for contact tracing by clicking the "Submit entry" button after filling out all the fields.
4. The submitted entry will be inputted in the "contact_tracing_entries.csv" along with other entries that have been submitted. This is where the program will search for names of the entires.
